1. Project Title

Leveraging Machine Learning for Demand Prediction in On-Demand Public Shuttle Services
2. Introduction
A brief overview of the problem: optimizing public shuttle services by accurately predicting passenger demand to reduce wait times and operational costs.

3. Features


Data Source: model_ready_trip_data.parquet 


Key Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib 


Model: RandomForestRegressor 

4. Methodology


Data Preparation: The dataset was read using pandas, sorted chronologically by timestamp, and cleaned. 


Feature Engineering: Features like Zone_ID, hour_of_day, day_of_week, and is_weekend were used as predictors. 

Data Splitting: The data was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 time-based ratio to prevent data leakage. The training set has 125,088 rows and the testing set has 31,272 rows. 


Model Training: A RandomForestRegressor model with n_estimators=100 and random_state=42 was trained on the prepared data. 

5. Results & Evaluation

The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.25. 

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 11.65. 


Interpretation: On average, the model's predictions were off by approximately 5.25 requests. 

6. How to Use

Prerequisites: List the required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).

Instructions: Provide simple steps to run the notebook.
